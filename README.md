This project has been developed using the MVVM architecture. Users can register using their email addresses via Firebase Authentication. Data has been fetched from themoviedb.org using the Retrofit library and displayed to the user. Items that users want to save to their own lists have been stored in the user's area on Firestore Database. The saving and deleting operations are performed through Firebase Firestore while maintaining an OOP approach. Asynchronous data flow within the architecture has been managed using Coroutines..
